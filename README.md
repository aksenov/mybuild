# MyBuild
MyBuild is the addon for Elder Scrolls Online (elderscrollsonline.com). It allows to view all build parameters in one window.

## ESOUI text
Finally! All characters build information in one place. With ESO addon MyBuild you can take just one screenshot, publish it on forums and all can see your build. Also, you can change your equipment and skills to see how your character's parameters change.

You can show information window with chat command /mybuild, or you can bind the hotkey to toggle it.

If you like my addon, you can (feed the cat) donate some game gold to my little khajiit R'Sharr on EU Server.
