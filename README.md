# MyBuild
MyBuild is the addon for Elder Scrolls Online (elderscrollsonline.com). It allows to view all build parameters in one window.

## ESOUI text
Finally! All character's build information in one place. With new add-on "My Build", you can take just one screenshot then publish it on forums and everyone will see your entire perfect (or may be strange) build. Also, you can adjust your equipment, stats and skills to see how your character's parameters are changing.

The information window will be displayed with chat command /mybuild, or you can bind the hotkey to toggle it.

If you like my add-on, you can (feed the cat) donate some game gold to my little khajiit R'Sharr on EU Server.
